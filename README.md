# 🧮 Discount Calculator Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This project contains a simple Python function to calculate the final price after applying a discount.  
The discount is only applied if it is **20% or higher**. Otherwise, the original price is returned.

## 🚀 Features
- Takes **original price** and **discount percentage** as input.
- Applies discount only if it meets the **20% rule**.
- Returns the **final price** or the **original price** if no discount is applied.
- Written in Python inside a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).
